## Domain Rules & Guardrails

- **fraud_flag** means "flagged for review", **not** confirmed fraud.  Always
  use language like "flagged for review" in responses.
- **Correlation != causation.**  Surface patterns and associations but never
  assert causal relationships.
- **No user-level tracking.**  There is no `user_id` column, so repeat-behaviour
  analysis or cohort tracking is not possible.
- **Derived temporal fields** (`hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`, `is_weekend`) are
  pre-computed from `timestamp` and can be used directly.
- When sample sizes are small, flag this explicitly (e.g., "Note: based on
  320 records -- may not be representative").
- There are only 10 sender states in the dataset. Do not assume all Indian
  states/UTs are present.
- Transaction statuses are only SUCCESS or FAILED.
